Hey folks!

I will continue with the same old story about deployment to the OnPremise environment. This time I want to tell you how we managed the favorite part of all teams — SSL certificates.

We have 2 cases:

1. Our development/testing environment (DNS available)

2. Closed(production) environment, DNSless— VPN

## HTTPS with a domain name

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0*QkBqHWDLixwnVbaZ.png)

In the case where we have the domain name, we just configured SSL certificate with **certbot **which is thousands of time described how to do it — [https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html)

## HTTPS on IP address

The second case was much more interesting. How do we enable a secure connection in a private network?

What do we have:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*_B0uNlZd8PUDMsb4.png)

* closed network (no access outside, so **certbot **can’t verify)

* no DNS (only IP address)

* Let’s Encrypt doesn’t issue certificates for IP addresses

To generate an SSL certificate for an IP address we decided to use [Azure KeyVault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/key-vault/).

Azure KeyVault — is secure storage for cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services.

So to have **https://ip_address** we will do next:

1. Create Azure KeyVault

1. Generate certificate

1. Download certificate

1. Use it on our Nginx configurations

Let’s dive.

## Create Azure KeyVault

To create Azure KeyVault you can use this instruction — [create KeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal#create-a-vault).

## Generate certificate

To generate your certificate just follow the next steps:

![Create certificate](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2750/1*NZ7qYGZLwlyMdfFqrpROpw.png)*Create certificate*

Next step is to fill configurations:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F5J5p4FEoqI8OYVVTiRN5Q.png)

In these configurations, there are a few important points to understand:

* [Type of Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)

* Subject or [X.500 Distinguished Names](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc/security-component/keytoolDocs/x500dnames.html)

* [PKCS #12 vs PEM](https://serverfault.com/questions/9708/what-is-a-pem-file-and-how-does-it-differ-from-other-openssl-generated-key-file)

Other things are up to you, as they are not obligatory to make our https on IP works, so I won’t cover them here.

As soon as our certificate is created, we have to be sure that it’s enabled:

![Created and enabled certificate](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3380/1*ybsMaWo5nIzU_se4LBvs-Q.png)*Created and enabled certificate*

## Download PEM and CERT

Next steps are easy:

1. Download certificate

1. Modify to use as SSL

1. Integrate

1. Tests

To download the certificate in Azure KeyVault, just open it and press Download in PFX/PEM format

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2282/1*0AGdKiZnSnFvMZjQOl8YeA.png)

Now when we have our PEM file, we need also CERT file to integrate it with NGINX. This step I find quite stupid, but it works.

We open PEM file and we copy this part:

    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIDpjCCAo6gAwIBAgIQ.........
    .......................vy75E=
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

and we save it as a separate *.cert file.

![*.cert with *.pem](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*S6aVoVU9tilU6h0oWlGjkQ.png)**.cert with *.pem*

## Integrate certificate with NGINX

This is the easiest part, as we just have to include the proper path to our certificate files like you do when you use certbot:

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/https/keyvault_priv.cert;        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/https/keyvault_priv_key.pem;

And all the magic works!

![[https://ip](https://ip)_address](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*h5EG3V8bxDiGn9X6OeLgzw.png)*[https://ip](https://ip)_address*

That’s all folks!

We implemented [**https://ip_addresss](https://ip_addresss). **Now we have our connection to the IP address secured by SSL certificate and all clients can use our website without worries.

## Trusted certificate

As soon as you succeded to achieve https on IP, you Web-browsers will show you this message:

![Not trusted certificate](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2270/1*TNm43I3kE_P_P1YAtb9Hyg.png)*Not trusted certificate*

In Chrome it’s shown like this:

![Not trusted certificate](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*r45CfJY9jExqmnOJ4z2DmA.png)*Not trusted certificate*

Which is normal, as a certificate which we generated was not validated by the Trusted Authority.

This can be fixed during the creation of the certificate, with paying to Trusted Authority:
